# Minting Tokens and NFTs

In this program we studied to run the code to mint the SPL tokens by connecting the phantom wallet and input desired amount.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solana, an L1 blockchain welcoming the devvelopers onboard. The contract uses the functions and creats an app to mint the tokens in the phantom wallet. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solana, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
